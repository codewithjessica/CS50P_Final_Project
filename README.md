# Canadian Sales Tax Calculator

#### Description:
Hi, My name is Jessica and this was my final project for the course, CS50P Introduction to Programming with Python.

My final project is a calculator to show the tax in different provinces of Canada. It allows the users to know how much is the tax and either the original price or the price with tax included price based on their inputs.
